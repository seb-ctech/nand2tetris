To compile c to exe

```gcc -Wall filename.c –o filename```

to generate temp compilations files

```gcc -Wall -save-temps filename.c –o filename```

## Compilation

hello.i

contains the c code without comments, with expanded macros and included code as intermediary step

hello.s

hello.o

this is machine instructions generated by the assembler

## Linking

The linker connects definition and implementations aswell as adding some additional functionality to turn .o into exe.
